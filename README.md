## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB

My learning was focused on creating a full stack app. I made a log in and sign up to store user data in a database. When signed in you can make and delete posts as well as like and dislike comments.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that your put request was triggering the comments to be deleted as well as what was increasing or decreasing your liked comment. I previously thought it was a post request.
